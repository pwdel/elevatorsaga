### Dependencies

* There are no dependencies, all of this is run through the [ElevatorSaga IDE](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/).

### Requirements

* [ElevatorSaga IDE](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/) must be working in the same state that it did as of July, 2021.

#### Versioning

Versioning and releases are kept track of via [tagging](/notes/tagging_releases.md).

### Behind the Scenes

#### Why Build this Project

* Elevator Saga is essentially a disk scheduling simulator, the core algorithms of which tangentially relates to database design.

#### What Problems this Solves

* This particular repo builds a generalized solution in which preceding levels ideally can be solved with the highest-level of built code.

### Learned Along the Way

* General javascript practices, scheduling algorithms and the interesting nuances in differences between scheduling algorithms and actual real world physical algorithms.

### Getting Started - How to Install and Run

1. Check the [versioning table above within README.md](/README.md#Versioning).
2. Copy and paste the contents of [](/main.js) into the [Elevator Saga IDE Interface]().
