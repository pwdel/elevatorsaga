## Getting Oriented

Upon opening ElevatorSaga.com for the first time, these are my initial reflections:

Elevator Saga appears to be an optimization game built upon the premise that we're transporting people on an elevator from level to level, maximizing for the amount of people transported within a period of time.

Presumably the coder/developer must solve different optimization problems as time proceeds.

### Initial Debug Problem

The below code is given at the start, minus the command, "elevator.goToFloor(2);" - which means that the initial code does not execute properly, leaving, "passengers," stranded on the top floor (index 2).

```
{
    init: function(elevators, floors) {
        var elevator = elevators[0]; // Let's use the first elevator

        // Whenever the elevator is idle (has no more queued destinations) ...
        elevator.on("idle", function() {
            // let's go to all the floors (or did we forget one?)
            elevator.goToFloor(0);
            elevator.goToFloor(1);
            elevator.goToFloor(2);
        });
    },
    update: function(dt, elevators, floors) {
        // We normally don't need to do anything here
    }
}
```
Upon successfully adding the (2) index in the IDE, the challenge is pre-solved to be able to transport 15 passengers (P=15) within 60 seconds (ET=60) among 3 floors (F=3).

### Sub-Metrics

There are several sub-metrics given on the side screen:

* Elapsed time (ET)
* Transported/s (TPS)
* Avg waiting time (TWAVG)
* Max waiting time (TWMAX)

Other observable measurements:

* Elevator maximum capacity (EMC) = 4

### Apparent Passenger Release Pattern

Running the elevator sequence twice we get the following release patterns:

* first_trial: [0,1,2,2,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,2,0,2,0,0]
* first_trial: [1,0,0,2,0,1,1,1,2,1,1,1,0,1,0,0]

Note that the pattern was different for each release, there evidently appears to be some kind of randomness introduced to the release pattern, whether that randomness is completely uniform or not is not known at this time as we don't have a sufficient sample.

Going to the next challenge, the release pattern seems as though it may bias toward the lower floor, but we can start off building based upon an agnostic passenger per floor model.

### Fourth Floor Introduced

Upon solving the first debug challenge, a fourth floor is introduced, leading to a discrete sampling problem.

Initially the code presented is the same as the first challenge. Adding additional floors in sequence leads to a, "passenger overflow error" in which the elevator continuously attempts to return and prioritizes lower floors in order to pick up missing passengers, meaning the elevator never climbs above floor 3, and the loaded passengers never exit.

```
{
    init: function(elevators, floors) {
        var elevator = elevators[0]; // Let's use the first elevator

        // Whenever the elevator is idle (has no more queued destinations) ...
        elevator.on("idle", function() {
            // let's go to all the floors (or did we forget one?)
            elevator.goToFloor(0);
            elevator.goToFloor(1);
            elevator.goToFloor(2);
            elevator.goToFloor(3);
            elevator.goToFloor(4);
            elevator.goToFloor(5);
        });
    },
    update: function(dt, elevators, floors) {
        // We normally don't need to do anything here
    }
```

The passenger release function appears to be similarly uniformly distributed, as such this is an expected outcome since the elevator maximum capacity is 4.

#### Skipping Ahead to Further Challenges

Observing the URL of the game, it ends with, "#challenge=2" - the "2" can be replaced to look forward into the game without having passed previous levels, allowing possibly for more generalizability.  Reviewing future levels:

* 3: 23 people in 60 seconds, 5 floors
* 4: 28 people in 60 seconds, 8 floors
* 5: 100 people in 68 seconsds, 6 floors
* 6: 40 people in 60 seconds, 4 floors, 2 elevators
* 7: 100 people in 63 moves or less, 3 floors, 3 elevators
* 8: 50 people, let no one wait more than 21 seconds, 6 floors
* 9: 50 people, no one waits more than 20 seconds, 3 elevators, 7 floors
* 10: 50 people, 70 seconds, 2 elevators, one of the elevators large
* 11: 60 people, 19 seconds, 5 elevators, 9 floors
* 12: 80 people, 17 seconds, 5 elevators, 9 floors
* 13: 100 people, 15 seconds, 5 elevators, 9 floors
* 14: 110 people, no one waits more than 15 seconds, 9 floors, 5 huge elevators
* 15: 120 people, no one waits more than 14 seconds, 6 elevators, 8 floors
* 16: 70 people, 80 seconds, 4 elevators with 2 huge ones, 12 floors
* 17: 110 people, 80 seconds, 5 huge elevators, 21 floors
* 18: 2675 people, 1800 seconds, no one waits >45 seconds, 8 elevators half huge, 21 floors
* 19: perpetual demo

There appear to be three main classes of problems:

* A: P (people) / s (seconds) - P/s total throughput in a defined time
* B: P in M(max) - total throughput in a defined number of moves
* C: P with W(max) - total throughput with maximum wait time

as well as:

* D: includes both A and C

### Initial Read of Documentation

While there may be an obvious optimization at this stage, presumably this is a good time to start reading [the documentation](https://play.elevatorsaga.com/documentation.html).

Beyond the documentation, there is also a Github repo, with the source code for the game itself available. [Challenges](https://github.com/magwo/elevatorsaga/blob/master/challenges.js) appear to layout the structure of future problems in terms of the following variables:

```
floorCount: (presumably the number of floors)
elevatorCount: (presumably the number of elevators)
spawnRate: (presumably the passenger respwan rate)
elevatorCapacities: (presumably the capacity of each elevator)
condition: requireUserCountWithinTime(70, 80) (presumably the time limit)
```
With the above variables, it might hypothetically be possible to jump forward in levels and, "mathematically solve," the program as one all-encompassing release which, "solves the program downward." However for learning purposes since there may be unforeseen anomalies it's probably best to start off solving challenge by challenge.

### Generalization Goal

The following specification was given for the project:

* Each solution to a given challenge # in elevatorsaga should be tagged as a release in your repo.  The hope is your solution can solve each challenge as one large program, not lots of smaller programs.

Nothing within this statement says that we can't shoot for the most generalizeable solution possible early in the game and then continue to build on each challenge based upon the most case agnostic solution from there on out.

### Playing with the IDE

To ensure capability to extract variables from the IDE, the following code was created to attempt to print out, "pressed button," commands to console.

```
{
    init: function(elevators, floors) {
        var elevator = elevators[0]; // Let's use the first elevator

        // Whenever the elevator is idle (has no more queued destinations) ...
        elevator.on("idle", function() {            
            // print out pressed floors
            elevator.logpressedfloors();
        });

        elevator.logpressedfloors = function() {
            // get the pressed floors
            if(elevator.getPressedFloors().length > 0) {
                // getPressedFloors returns an arr per github source
                var pressedFloors = elevator.getPressedFloors()
                // print to console
                console.log('pressedFloors:',pressedFloors)
            }
        }

    },

    update: function(dt, elevators, floors) {
        // We normally don't need to do anything here
    }
}
```

### General Solution Optimization Research

Through a quick review of literature around elevator scheduling, it seems that there are at least two distinct schools of thought on the problem from a mathematical perspective:

* Literal Elevator Scheduling (LES), improving how actual elevators operate in the physical world.
* Hard Disk Arm Read Scheduling (HDARS), which involves a set of programming algorithms which in this world they call, "the elevator scheduling problem," which is similar to Literal Elevator Scheduling, but more idealized.

Quick notes on the above:

* Some blogs on LES refer to HDARS and vice versa.
* LES seems to involve using HDARS in some cases but also may involve algorithms which might not typically be discussed in HDARS such as using Markov models to optimize decision making.
* For the most part, Elevator Saga seems to model HDARS because the, "passengers," seem likely to spawn at any given floor at any time and get off at any floor at any time rather than in a physical world elevator in which passengers are more likely to have a highly utilized port on the ground level since people tend to leave buildings. In other words, there is a much higher probability field in a real world elevator than within Elevator Saga - which more approximates the world of reading data from rotating disks.
* Also note that somewhat confusingly, one type of HDARS is also known as, "Elevator Scheduling," but it is also known as SCAN.

#### Found Resources on Rotating Disk Algorithms

* [Disks and I/O Scheduling](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~porter/courses/comp530/f20/slides/disk-scheduling.pdf)
* [Wikipedia - Elevator Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elevator_algorithm)
* [Wikipedia - FIFO](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FIFO_(computing_and_electronics)
* [Wikipedia - FSCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FSCAN)
* [Wikipedia - NStep-SCAN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-Step-SCAN)
* [Wikipedia - LOOK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LOOK_algorithm)

##### Summary of Disks and I/O Scheduling Presentation PDF

* Presentation suggests building a formula to optimize for latency.
* First off, there is the FCFS algorithm - Assume a queue of requests exists to read/write tracks, follow that queue. This does not optimize for time.
* SSTF or, "Greedy" scheduling suggests rearranging the queue by, "shortest time." So using a latency formula, minimuze total latency by rearranging the queue.
* There are problems with SSTF/Greedy, in that, "farther away," requests starve for waiting time, and the disk head (or in our case, elevator) tends to hover toward the middle.
* SCAN scheduling suggests just moving the head/elevator in one direction until all requests have
been serviced, and then reverse. This particular algorithm is also known as, "Elevator Scheduling."
* SCAN seems most efficient in general.
* Circular SCAN (CSCAN): Move the head in one direction until an edge of the disk is reached, and then reset to the opposite edge.
* C-SCAN offers better fairness at marginal cost, may be better under certain workloads.

This presentation goes into:

* Disk partitioning, and
* Redundant Arrays of Inexpensive Disks (RAID) - which helps with throughput.

RAID may be analogous to multiple elevators. We may return to optimization under these conditions later in the Elevator Saga.

##### Hypothesis of Disk Scheduling vs. Problem Classes

* A: P/s - SCAN would likely help with total throughput, again assuming that floors are equally biased.
* B: max moves - SCAN does seem like it would minimize movement vs. a greedy search
* C: max waiting time - greedy search would potentially be better at reducing latency or, "wait time" on average, but as mentioned above, there may be stragglers and it may not optimize for one individual's maximum wait time, e.g. "farther away" requests starve for waiting time and the elevator hovers toward the middle.

### Psuedocode Draft Based Upon Basic Understanding of Standard Algorithms

#### SCAN

> ...moving the head/elevator in one direction until all requests have
been serviced, then reverse...

```

{
  init: function(elevators, floors) {

    // by convention, start at floor 0 - BOTTOMFLOOR = 0

    // pop top floor into, "schedule" destinationQueue and start elevator immediately, don't wait for lower floor passenger

    // Find maximum number of floors, topFloor - NUMFLOORS / TOPFLOOR (for general solution)

    // Estimate passenger quantity, or at least if there are any passengers with loadFactor > 0

    // if there are passengers, proceed, if not idle() until allRequests has floor along path

    // Check exterior requests prior to each passing_floor with floor_button_pressed - exteriorRequests

    // Check continuously, interior requests: getPressedFloors - interiorRequests

    // combine interiorRequests and exteriorRequests into allRequests, order allRequests sequentially relative to current position and SCAN direction

    // update "schedule" destinationQueue based upon allRequests and currentFloor

    // Move elevator toward topFloor -> goToFloor in topFloor direction

    // At each floorNum reached, if currentFloor === one_of_the( allRequests ), reload passengers

    // NOTE --- do not use, "stop" - this is used for a different purpose, not for stopping at floors

    // Once reached TopFloor, insert bottom floor [0] into scheduling queue - destinationQueue.

    // repeat the above pattern in reverse until reaching BOTTOMFLOOR

    // Repeat pattern back to TOPFLOOR


  }

}

```

Note -

* "exterior requests" (wall buttons) appear to be the array from floor_button_pressed
* "interior requests" (elevator floor buttons) appear to be getPressedFloors
* use going up / going down indicators to affect possible passenger behavior, "somehow" (per the documentation)

The below variables were not used in the above pseudocode thus far:

* maxPassengerCount - the actual capacity of the elevator
* goingUpIndicator / goingDownIndicator
* destinationDirection
* stopped_at_floor
* idle

##### Possible Ideas to Improve Above Hypothetical Solution

* Don't stop at exterior pushed floor unless equal to interior pushed floor if elevator is, "full," (which is an estimate based upon loadFactor)
* Possibly wait for lower floor passenger if we find that there is ideed a bias toward that floor

#### Further Documentation Notes

We noticed in the documentation:

> goingDownIndicator / goingUpIndicator - Gets or sets the going down/up indicator, which will affect passenger behavior when stopping at floors.

This may indicate that request changes may adjust based upon elevator availability - e.g. the passengers may have some intelligence built-in which could help optimize for elevator throughput.

#### Source Code Notes

There appears to be more functionality which can be found in the source code, not shown in the documentation:

* [base.js](https://github.com/magwo/elevatorsaga/blob/master/base.js)

* [floor.js](https://github.com/magwo/elevatorsaga/blob/master/floor.js)

```
floor.buttonStates = {up: "", down: ""};
```

#### Verifying Elements from Documentation which Can Be Derived from API

Using, "/notes/crazyland.js" and copy and pasting elements from the documentation, the following variables were able to successfully print to console log given the demonstrated functions:

```
{
    init: function(elevators, floors) {
        var elevator = elevators[0]; // Let's use the first elevator

        // Find maximum number of floors, topFloor - NUMFLOORS / TOPFLOOR (for general solution)
        // by convention, start at floor 0 - BOTTOMFLOOR = 0
        const BOTTOMFLOOR = 0;
        // since index starts at 0, topfloor number will be top-1
        const TOPFLOOR = floors.length - 1;

        // Log top and bottom floor
        console.log('the TOPFLOOR is: ',TOPFLOOR)
        console.log('the BOTTOMFLOOR is: ',BOTTOMFLOOR)

        // pop top floor into, "schedule" destinationQueue and start elevator immediately,
        // don't wait for lower floor passenger
        elevator.destinationQueue = [TOPFLOOR];
        elevator.checkDestinationQueue();
        console.log('destinationQueue: ',elevator.destinationQueue)

        // Estimate passenger quantity, or at least if there are any passengers with loadFactor > 0
        // elevatorloadfactor is a function
        console.log('loadFactor: ',elevator.loadFactor())

        // Check continuously, interior requests: getPressedFloors - interiorRequests - elevator.getPressedFloors()
        //interior requests
        elevator.on("floor_button_pressed", function(floorNum) {
          // Maybe tell the elevator to go to that floor?
          console.log('interiorRequests to floorNum: ',floorNum)
        });


        // Check exterior requests prior to each passing_floor with floor_button_pressed - exteriorRequests
        floors.forEach(function(floor){
            floor.on("up_button_pressed", function() {
                console.log('exteriorRequest UP on floorNum: ', floor.floorNum());
            });
            floor.on("down_button_pressed", function() {
                console.log('exteriorRequest DOWN on floorNum:', floor.floorNum());
            });
        });


        // Check current floor numbers and direction for passing floors
        // this gets triggered just previous to a floor being passed, in case stop is needed
        elevator.on("passing_floor", function(floorNum, direction) {
          // print the passing floor
          console.log('passingFloorNum: ',floorNum)
          // print the direction
          console.log('direction: ',direction)
          });


        // combine interiorRequests and exteriorRequests into allRequests, order allRequests sequentially relative to current position and SCAN direction

        // update "schedule" destinationQueue based upon allRequests and currentFloor
        // schedule might need a helper function


        // Move elevator toward topFloor -> goToFloor in topFloor direction
        // move elevator might need some kind of helper function


        // At each floorNum reached, if currentFloor === one_of_the( allRequests ), reload passengers
        // skip floors not currently on requests / schedule

        // NOTE --- do not use, "stop" - this is used for a different purpose, not for stopping at floors

        // Once reached TopFloor, insert bottom floor [0] into scheduling queue - destinationQueue.

        // repeat the above pattern in reverse until reaching BOTTOMFLOOR

        // Repeat pattern back to TOPFLOOR

    },

    update: function(dt, elevators, floors) {
        // We normally don't need to do anything here
    }
}

```

#### Sketching Out the Algorithm

Based upon the above exercise, we know that the following variables can be easily extracted:

* BOTTOMFLOOR
* TOPFLOOR
* destinationQueue - queue of next destinations in array
* loadFactor - decimal digit showing how loaded elevator is
* interiorRequests - cascading array of floorNum, requested internally
* exteriorRequestUP - floornum for up button pressed, manually created function
* exteriorRequestDOWN - floornum for down button pressed, manually created function
* passingFloorNum - the floor about to pass next
* direction - current direction

From the above variables, we can attempt to write out a SCAN style algorithm, leveraging a central, neutral, "check if stop at next floor," function.  The concept behind, "stop at next floor," is something like this:

![](/img/nextfloorstop_concept.png)

Where essentially, flx, the next floor, independent of direction, should be able to be determined by the in-game variable, "passingFloorNum," since passingFloorNum activates slightly before flx is reached, independent of direction.

Other decision making datapoints can be determined from request arrays both internal and external, as well as load status.

All of this assumes a general overall SCAN-style, "sweeping," operation in which the elevator proceeds between the top and bottom floors.

This of course is mimicking and optimization function presuming that all floors are equally biased in terms of numbers of people loading at each floor, and that passenger behavior will not change with up and down arrows, neither of which may be true.

The overall, SCAN-style "sweeping," algorithm can be diagramed as follows:

![](/img/overall_CSCAN_scheduler_diagram.png)

Within that, a, "nextfloorstop ( direction, passingFlorNum, exteriorRequests, interiorRequests, load )" function may be built which follows roughly the below decision diagram:

![](/img/nextfloorstop_function_diagram.png)

The, "nextflorstop()" function may serve as a sort of centerpoint in the philosophy of buidling a SCAN-based elevator scheduler. Overall, since the focus is on looping the elevator(s) back and fourth, we might think of the overall program itself happening as a for loop which checks for outside button presses on a continuous basis, almost like a microcontroller:

![](/img/microcontroller_model_concept.png)

Within this paradigm, there is a, "requests" transformation which must happen to translate external requests which might happen on a regular basis to a dictionary type object, which would be much more easily referenceable.

In short, the dictionary object would work as follows:

* Create an entry for each floor, for either, "Up Requests," "Down Requests," or "Interior Requests."
* For any floor requested, turn the dictionary entry for that floor to 1.
* Once we hit a floor and after opening the door and starting again, the entry for that dictionary item goes back to 0.

Dictionary entries do not re-route the elevator, they just tell the elevator, from a binary perspective whether to open or not:

![](/img/requeststransformer_diagram.png)

The, "check if reached" function checks the output of the, "requests transformer," and looks at whether a given floor has been reached, given the in-game input "passingFloorNum" - if "passingFloorNum" equals any of the dict object requests, then add that value to the scheduler previous to the either, "TOPLOOR," or, "BOTTOMFLOOR."

After the elevator starts again, the value gets removed in favor of TOPFLOOR or BOTTOMFLOOR.

![](/img/checkifreached_function_diagram.png)

Finally, there should be a, "move elevator," function which actually commands the elevator itself to move, given the decision making in the above functions.

![](/img/moveelevator_function_diagram.png)

#### Building the Algorithm in Code

* The first code we have to test out accessing variables and showing them on the console is [crazyland.js](/notes/crazyland.md).
* Secondly, generating a function that simply moves the elevator to the top and then bottom floor via switching out the scheduler variable, destinationQueue, at [movingelevator.js](/notes/movingelevator.md)
* Thirdly, finding out that the way to move the elevator up and down is actually through the idle function, not the update function, as discussed in [mainloop.md](/notes/mainloop.md)
* Fourthly, finding out that we get reference erros when trying to pass the variable, "floorNumPass" within our movingelevator.js function, that it's not as simple as creating a variable within the elevator function and going from there, discussed in [floornumpass.md](/notes/floornumpass.md).
* Fifth, once the elevator is able to move up and down using, "currentFloorNow," within, [movingelevator.js](/notes/movingelevator.md) and two helper functions, additional stopping logic functions can be built using outside signals to tell the elevator to stop at various floors based upon the interior signal with [interiorsignalstop.js](/notes/interiorsignalstop.js) and [interiorsignalstop.md](/notes/interiorsignalstop.md).
* Deciding how to stop and operate the elevator must be done in a dictionary object, rather than a list, to prevent erratic operation.  We discuss and establish functionality for this at: [interiorrequestdictionary.js](/notes/interiorrequestdictionary.js).
* Checking whether a given floor had been reached and therefore setting a requestDict value to 0 is dependant not upon looking at which floor was passed, which happens **before** a signal to stop is removed, but rather it is dependant upon looking at an array of requests, and comparing that to a past array of requests, as established at [destinationQueueCheck.js](/notes/destinationQueueCheck.js)
* An overall architecture, which includes the over-arching, "movingelevator.js" function and several helper files is included at [movingelevatorwithhelpers.js](/notes/movingelevatorwithhelpers.js)
